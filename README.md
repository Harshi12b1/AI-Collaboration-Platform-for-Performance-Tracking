# AI-Collaboration-Platform-for-Performance-Tracking

This AI Collaboration Platform is designed to track, assess, and enhance student participation in group-based academic projects. It allows students, instructors, and administrators to collaborate in a centralized space with role-based access.

Instructors can create student profiles, assign them to project groups, post tasks, and set deadlines.

Students can submit tasks, participate in discussions, and receive real-time feedback on their contributions.

Admins manage system-level settings and monitor overall engagement analytics.

The system uses AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to evaluate student involvement through task submissions, discussion messages, and communication logs. It generates personalized feedback reports, detects inactive members, and ensures fair performance ratings based on team collaboration and individual effort.

The platform is built with:

Frontend: HTML, CSS (Flexbox, Grid)

Backend: Python (Flask)

AI Module: Custom NLP techniques for sentiment analysis and contribution tracking

Database: SQLite/MySQL

Features: Real-time MCQ generation using AJAX, automated alerts, role-based access, AI-powered analytics
